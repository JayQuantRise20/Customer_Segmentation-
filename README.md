### Customer_Segmentation-

Customer segmentation based on German Population demographic Data

### 1.Project Description
In this project, we  analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. We used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I applied what I had learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and used a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that  we used has been provided by  Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics on behalf of **Udacity**, and represents a real-life data science task.
